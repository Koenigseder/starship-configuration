# PowerShell Starship configuration

This is my personal [Starship](https://starship.rs/) configuration for PowerShell 7.
My terminal uses a Nerdfont named [CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), so get a nice font family with beautiful icons.

# Setup

- Install the Nerd Font
- Install Starship for PowerShell
- Modify your `starship.toml` configuration file

**Note:** A full documentation can be found at [www.starship.rs](https://starship.rs).
